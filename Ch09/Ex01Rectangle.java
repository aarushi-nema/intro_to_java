/**
 * Q: Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
        1. Two double data fields named width and height that specify the
        width and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height .
       2. A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
       3. A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height .
       4. A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
       5. A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
    Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height
    40 , and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9 . Display the width, height,
    area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.
